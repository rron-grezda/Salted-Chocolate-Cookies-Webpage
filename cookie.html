    <h1>Salted Chocolate Cookies</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Made with 2 types of cocoa powder for an intensely deep chocolate flavor, these salted dark chocolate cookies
            feature crisp edges and soft chewy centers just like chewy fudgy frosted brownies.
            A sprinkle of sea salt is the perfect finishing touch on each fudge-like cookie.

            <h2>How to prepare</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour is the base of these cookies. We don't use as much as in non-chocolate cookie
                    recipes because the cocoa powder also provides structure.</li>
                <li><b>Cocoa Powder:</b> For intense dark chocolate flavor, use 2 types of cocoa powders—natural cocoa powder and
                    Hershey's special dark cocoa powder. Have you ever used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder before? It's deep,
                    dark, and bold. This is actually a cocoa powder that's a blend of natural cocoa and dutched cocoa (and here is
                    even more information about <a href="#">Dutch-process vs. natural cocoa powder</a>). It really heightens the chocolate flavor in
                    these cookies!</li>
                <li><b>Baking Soda:</b> Baking soda helps the cookies rise.</li>
                <li><b>Salt & Vanilla Extract:</b> Both add flavor. Try using <a href="#">homemade vanilla extract</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Butter:</b> Butter adds delicious flavor and texture.</li>
                <li><b>Sugar:</b> We use a combination of granulated sugar and brown sugar for sweetness and softness.</li>
                <li><b>Egg:</b> 1 egg helps bind everything together.</li>
                <li><b>Milk:</b> Milk smooths out the cookie dough.</li>
                <li><b>Chocolate Chips & Chunks:</b> Use a handful of chocolate chips and pure chocolate chopped into chunks—the
                    pure chocolate chunks melt down since they do not contain any stabilizers (unlike chocolate chips) and create pools of chocolate inside and outside of the cookies. Those chocolate pools from the pure baking chocolate are precisely what readers love the most about these dark chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies, too. You could even use a combination of your favorite chocolate chips, like we do for triple chocolate chip cookies. Just keep the total amount of add-ins to about 1 cup.</li>
                <li><b>Sprinkle of Sea Salt:</b> The sea salt offsets the sweetness and brings out even more chocolate flavor. We add a touch to these salty sweet chocolate covered pretzel cookies, too.</li>
            </ul>
